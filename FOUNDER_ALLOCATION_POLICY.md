# Founder Allocation Policy

In Equorum, the Genesis Vesting Contract represents the founder compensation allocation defined at deployment.

Founder allocations are vested linearly over time and exist to support long-term protocol development and operations.

Vested tokens may be used gradually for development, maintenance, partnerships, or liquidity support.

Founder allocations do not grant governance control and are excluded from protocol voting.

All founder allocations, vesting schedules, and beneficiary addresses are publicly disclosed and enforced on-chain.
