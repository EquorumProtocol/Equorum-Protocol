# Equorum Protocol

**Minimalist DeFi Protocol for Arbitrum L2**

Equorum is a streamlined, gas-optimized DeFi protocol built specifically for Arbitrum Layer 2. It provides essential functionality for token distribution, staking, governance, and vesting with a focus on security, efficiency, and immutability.

> **Note:**  
> This protocol is in early stage.  
> Contracts are live on Arbitrum One but governance and liquidity are still bootstrapping.

## Contracts

### 1. EquorumToken.sol
Main ERC20 token with fixed supply and distribution logic.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed supply: 48,000,000 EQM
- Automatic distribution on deployment
- Pausable for emergencies
- Blacklist functionality
- Immutable (no upgradability)

**Token Distribution:**
```
38.0M  (79.17%) → Staking rewards
4.0M   (8.33%)  → ICO/Sale
3.0M   (6.25%)  → Genesis vesting (72 months)
2.256M (4.70%)  → Faucet
500K   (1.04%)  → Initial liquidity
122K   (0.25%)  → Foundation reserve
122K   (0.25%)  → Corporate reserve
```

### 2. EquorumStaking.sol
**DYNAMIC APY** staking system (like central bank regulating interest rates).

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic APY: 1.0% - 3.5%** (auto-regulated every 30 days)
- **Low utilization (<25%)** → APY 3.5% (incentivize staking)
- **High utilization (>75%)** → APY 1.5% (control inflation)
- **Medium utilization (25-75%)** → APY 2.5% (balanced)
- Cooldown period: 7 days
- Withdrawal with cooldown
- Reward calculation per second
- Anyone can trigger APY adjustment (decentralized)

**Innovation:**
- Works like FED/ECB regulating interest rates
- Sustainable tokenomics (no 1000% APY scams)
- Predictable 30-day adjustment periods
- Transparent and automatic
- Withdrawal available when paused

### 3. EquorumGovernance.sol
On-chain governance with proposal and voting system.

**Key Features:**
- Proposal threshold: 10,000 EQM
- Voting period: 7 days
- Quorum: 4% of total supply
- 1 token = 1 vote
- Execution via TimeLock

### 4. TimeLock.sol
Security mechanism for delayed execution.

**Key Features:**
- Minimum delay: 48 hours
- Queue → Execute pattern
- Cancellation allowed
- Grace period: 7 days

### 5. EquorumGenesisVesting.sol
**IMMUTABLE** vesting contract for founder allocation (payment for development).

**Key Features:**
- Total allocation: 3M EQM (6.25% of supply)
- Duration: 72 months (6 years)
- Monthly release: ~41,666.67 EQM (automatic)
- Month 72: Releases remaining balance to complete exactly 3M
- Withdrawal with 48h delay
- Manual release for missed months

**Security & Anti-Manipulation:**
- 100% IMMUTABLE - Cannot be changed after deployment
- NO admin functions - No one can stop vesting
- Genesis CANNOT vote in governance
- Genesis CANNOT stake tokens
- Genesis ONLY receives vested tokens as payment

Token Transfer:       ~50,000 gas
Stake:               ~100,000 gas
Unstake:             ~120,000 gas

## What's Next

**We're focused on product-market fit, not features.**

### Next 30 Days
- Get 50+ people staking
- Complete first governance proposal
- Interview 30+ DeFi users
- Learn what people actually need

### After That
- Build what users tell us they want
- Fix what users tell us is broken
- Improve based on real feedback
- Scale what works

**No new contracts until we have 50 active users.**

See [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) for detailed plan.
