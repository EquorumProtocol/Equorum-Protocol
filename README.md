## 📦 Contracts

### 1. EquorumToken.sol
Main ERC20 token with fixed supply and distribution logic.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed supply: 48,000,000 EQM
- Automatic distribution on deployment
- Pausable for emergencies
- Blacklist functionality
- Immutable (no upgradability)

**Token Distribution:**
```
38.0M  (79.17%) → Staking rewards
4.0M   (8.33%)  → ICO/Sale
3.0M   (6.25%)  → Genesis vesting (72 months)
2.256M (4.70%)  → Faucet
500K   (1.04%)  → Initial liquidity
122K   (0.25%)  → Foundation reserve
122K   (0.25%)  → Corporate reserve
```

### 2. EquorumStaking.sol
**DYNAMIC APY** staking system (like central bank regulating interest rates).

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic APY: 1.0% - 3.5%** (auto-regulated every 30 days)
- **Low utilization (<25%)** → APY 3.5% (incentivize staking)
- **High utilization (>75%)** → APY 1.5% (control inflation)
- **Medium utilization (25-75%)** → APY 2.5% (balanced)
- Cooldown period: 7 days
- Emergency withdrawal
- Reward calculation per second
- Anyone can trigger APY adjustment (decentralized)

**Innovation:**
- Works like FED/ECB regulating interest rates
- Sustainable tokenomics (no 1000% APY scams)
- Predictable 30-day adjustment periods
- Transparent and automatic
- Emergency withdrawal (when paused)

### 3. EquorumGovernance.sol
On-chain governance with proposal and voting system.

**Key Features:**
- Proposal threshold: 10,000 EQM
- Voting period: 7 days
- Quorum: 4% of total supply
- 1 token = 1 vote
- Execution via TimeLock

### 4. TimeLock.sol
Security mechanism for delayed execution.

**Key Features:**
- Minimum delay: 48 hours
- Queue → Execute pattern
- Cancellation allowed
- Grace period: 7 days

### 5. EquorumGenesisVesting.sol
**IMMUTABLE** vesting contract for founder allocation (payment for development).

**Key Features:**
- Total allocation: 3M EQM (6.25% of supply)
- Duration: 72 months (6 years)
- Monthly release: ~41,666.67 EQM (automatic)
- Month 72: Releases remaining balance to complete exactly 3M
- Emergency withdrawal (48h delay)
- Manual release for missed months

**Security & Anti-Manipulation:**
- ✅ 100% IMMUTABLE - Cannot be changed after deployment
- ✅ NO admin functions - No one can stop vesting
- ✅ Genesis CANNOT vote in governance
- ✅ Genesis CANNOT stake tokens
- ✅ Genesis ONLY receives vested tokens as payment

   constructor(adminAddress) # Can be multisig

5. EquorumGovernance
   constructor(equorumTokenAddress, timeLockAddress, genesisVestingAddress)

6. Configure EquorumToken:
   token.setStakingContract(stakingAddress)
   token.setGenesisVesting(vestingAddress)
   token.setFaucetContract(faucetAddress)      # If applicable
