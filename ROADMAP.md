# Equorum Protocol - Product Roadmap

**Building a Real Protocol with Real Users**

---

## 🎯 Vision

Equorum is a **governance and staking protocol** on Arbitrum One. We have 8 deployed contracts that work. Our focus is making them useful to real people, not building more contracts.

This roadmap is about **product**, not code. It's about users, not features.

## 🗺️ Product Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ **COMPLETED** (Dec 2024)

**What We Built:**
- 8 core contracts deployed on Arbitrum One
- All contracts verified on Arbiscan
- Whitepaper and documentation published
- Faucet activated for testing
- Community channels (Discord, Twitter, Bitcointalk)

**What We Have:**
- Working token with vesting
- Functional staking with rewards
- Decentralized governance (48h timelock)
- Public distribution system
- Treasury management

---

### Phase 2: Product-Market Fit 🎯 **Q1 2025** (90 days)

**Goal:** Get real users using the protocol

**Metrics:**
- 50+ unique addresses staking
- 10+ addresses participating in governance
- 1 complete governance cycle (proposal → vote → execution)
- 30+ user interviews completed

**Activities:**
1. **User Acquisition (Weeks 1-4)**
   - Create simple onboarding guide
   - Activate generous faucet for testing
   - Daily outreach in Arbitrum communities
   - Track why people stake (or don't)

2. **Governance Activation (Weeks 5-8)**
   - Create first real governance proposal
   - Guide 10+ people through voting
   - Document entire governance flow
   - Identify friction points

3. **User Research (Weeks 9-12)**
   - Interview 30+ DeFi users
   - Understand what they need
   - Define Equorum's unique value
   - Validate product direction

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear answer to: "Equorum is the best way to ________ on Arbitrum"
- Active community using the protocol
- Data-driven understanding of user needs

---

### Phase 3: Product Improvement 🔧 **Q2 2025** (90 days)

**Goal:** Fix what users tell us is broken

**Based on Phase 2 learnings, we might:**
- Improve staking UX
- Simplify governance participation
- Add features users actually want
- Integrate with other Arbitrum protocols
- Build tools that solve real problems

**Note:** This phase is intentionally vague. We'll define it based on what we learn in Phase 2.

---

### Phase 4: Growth 📈 **Q3-Q4 2025** (6 months)

**Goal:** Scale what works

**Only if Phase 2 succeeds:**
- Expand user base 10x
- Increase TVL significantly
- Build partnerships
- Develop ecosystem tools
- Consider additional features

**Note:** We only get here if we have product-market fit.

## 📈 Success Metrics

### What Matters

| Metric | Current | Q1 2025 Target | Q2 2025 Target |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Active Stakers | ~5 | 50+ | 200+ |
| Governance Participants | 0 | 10+ | 30+ |
| Proposals Executed | 0 | 1+ | 5+ |
| User Interviews | 0 | 30+ | 100+ |
| TVL (EQM) | ~10K | 100K+ | 500K+ |

**We measure users, not contracts.**

---

## 🎯 Phase 2 Success Criteria

### We succeed when:

1. **50+ people are actively staking** - Not test wallets, real users
2. **We complete 1 governance cycle** - Real proposal, real votes, real execution
3. **We can answer the question** - "What problem does Equorum solve?"
4. **Users tell us what to build next** - Not us guessing in isolation

### We fail if:

1. We build more contracts without users
2. We focus on "features" instead of problems
3. We can't explain why someone should use Equorum
4. We're still at <10 active users after 90 days

## 💰 Resource Allocation

### Phase 2 Focus (Q1 2025)

| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| User Acquisition | 40% | Faucet, incentives, outreach |
| Documentation | 30% | Guides, tutorials, support |
| Community Building | 20% | Discord, support, engagement |
| Research | 10% | User interviews, data analysis |

**Zero budget for:**
- New smart contracts
- Complex features
- "Nice to have" tools
- Anything users didn't ask for

---

## 🔒 Security

### Current Status

- 8 contracts deployed and verified
- Open source on GitHub
- Internal security review completed
- External audit planned for Phase 2
- 48-hour timelock on all governance actions

### Bug Bounty (Planned)

- **Status:** To be launched after external audit
- **Planned Rewards:** TBD based on audit findings

**We focus on securing what exists, not building more attack surface.**

---

## 🌐 How to Get Involved

### We Need:

1. **Users** - Actually use the protocol, give feedback
2. **Testers** - Try staking, try governance, tell us what breaks
3. **Researchers** - Help us understand what people need
4. **Community** - Spread the word, help others onboard
5. **Critics** - Tell us what's wrong, what's missing

### We Don't Need (Yet):

- More smart contract developers
- Complex feature proposals
- Integrations with 10 other protocols
- Marketing campaigns

**First users, then everything else.**
