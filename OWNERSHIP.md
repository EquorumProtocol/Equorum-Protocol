# Ownership & Decentralization Plan

## Current Status

**Owner:** 0x04B285a392FFA8B8D23BA6a239C9BB7141C5391d (Deployer)  
**Status:** Temporary administrative control  
**Reason:** Protocol in early testing phase

---

## What Owner Can Do

**Emergency Controls:**
- Pause token transfers (security emergencies only)
- Blacklist malicious addresses (exploits, attacks)

**All actions:**
- Emit on-chain events (publicly visible)
- Verifiable on Arbiscan
- Documented and transparent

---

## Why Temporary Ownership?

**Early Stage Requirements:**
- Protocol needs ability to respond to bugs quickly
- No active community yet for multisig governance
- Standard practice for new protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Compound all started this way)

**This is NOT permanent.**

## Decentralization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Current (Month 1-3)
**Ownership:** Single deployer (temporary)  
**Focus:** Build community and test protocol  
**Milestones:**
- 50+ active holders
- Active Discord community
- Regular engagement on social media
- Protocol stability verified

### Phase 2: Community Multisig (Month 3-6)
**Ownership:** Gnosis Safe multisig (3/5 or 2/3)  
**Signatories:** Deployer + active community members  
**Focus:** Shared control with trusted community  
**Requirements:**
- Identify 4-5 trusted community members
- Create Gnosis Safe on Arbitrum
- Transfer ownership to multisig
- Document all signatories publicly

### Phase 3: Full Governance (Month 6-12)
**Ownership:** TimeLock contract (governance-controlled)  
**Control:** Token holders vote on all changes  
**Focus:** Complete decentralization  
**Requirements:**
- 100+ active holders
- Functional governance participation
- Proven community engagement
- Transfer ownership to TimeLock

## Transparency Commitments

**We commit to:**
1. Document all owner actions publicly
2. Provide advance notice for non-emergency actions
3. Transfer ownership when community is ready
4. Never use admin powers for personal benefit

**You can verify:**
- All transactions on Arbiscan
- Owner address: 0x04B285a392FFA8B8D23BA6a239C9BB7141C5391d
- Contract addresses in README.md
- All events emitted on-chain

---

## Timeline

**Target for Phase 2:** Q2 2026 (3-6 months)  
**Target for Phase 3:** Q3-Q4 2026 (6-12 months)

**Timeline depends on:**
- Community growth rate
- Protocol stability
- Governance participation
- Market conditions

## Questions?

**Q: Why not decentralize now?**  
A: No community yet. Multisig needs trusted members. Governance needs active voters. Building community first, then decentralizing.

**Q: How do we know you'll actually transfer ownership?**  
A: It's in our interest. Decentralized protocols are more valuable and trusted. Plus, all actions are public and verifiable.

**Q: What if there's an emergency?**  
A: Owner can pause immediately. After Phase 2, multisig can act. After Phase 3, governance can vote on emergency actions.
